                    I worked in a 2D video game where the player utilizes portals to move
                    from one point to another. You also weild a weapon to to fight the enemies

                I made a prototype of a game when I could. I was able to code in the movement
                of the player with my own sprite design. I animated the movement and the enemies
                as seen in the gif. As you can see the player can climb the wall and jump
            </p>

                Furthermore, the enemies all have unique movement that chase at the player. 
                I used several statements that allowed the enemies attack based on conditions
                being met. This is seen the most with the bear and tree.

                I also made a menu that allowed the user to navigate to pick weapons. I 
                wasn't able to implement the whole menu, so I only put in a canvas with 
                possible items that the player would use.
