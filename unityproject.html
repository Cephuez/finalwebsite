            For most of my spare time, I worked on my own videogame designs. I worked with 
            Unity Engine since it provides everything for me to start a game. For my game
            projects, I created my own assets like sprite animations, sounds, and code. I 
            coded the physics of the game, character movement, animation, sound design, AI
            controls, and others. Even though my game projects are unfinished, I can 
            demonstrate how it looks like through gifs. I have linked my coding scripts 
            to my github page. You can click the button above to read them. They were all 
            coded in C#.

                I would like to demonstrate my work through my Mysterious Forest
                prototype game. As you can see, I code the running , dashing, and 
                climbing animations. You can see two unique enemies that have a different 
                pathing. Yellow monster walks left and right, while tortoise tries to chase 
                the player. I also provide a inventory menu where the player could change 
                weapons and items.

                Furthermore, I demonstrate more different enemies. A bear that waits before 
                charging at the player, and a monkey that jumps to the location of the player.
            </p>

                The next enemies is a plant that shoots a spike at the player's position, a 
                plant that uses whips to attack at the player, and a living tree that moves once 
                the player is near them.

                The last one is a bird that chargest its flight power before charging at 
                the player. The bird continues to charge at the player until they are 
                out of sight.

                My games were a prototype that allowed me to play with a lot of 
                Unity's features. I played with different AI coding by making each enemy
                have a unique pathing to attack the player. You are free to view my code 
                under every .c files in my Unity Project folder over github. You can 
                click the button at the top to navigate to it.
