        <h2>
            For my CPU project, a few milestones needed to be reached before moving 
            to more advance coding. For the first part, I needed to code the processes 
            that the computer will have to run during Kernel mode. This is where I check 
            that the computer is not running in User mode, and running my processes in 
            multi-thread. The second part is allowing user-level processes to use system 
            services, but not directly called it in user mode either. This is where I 
            will code in drivers to handle these kernel processes such as clock and 
            disk drivers. Finally, the last part would be storing information in virtual
            memory. I used paging to have a specific size of chunk, and used page replacement
            algorithm such as FIFO, MIN, LRU, and LFU to sort these pages into open space.

            <p> 
                For the first phase, I coded in processes to be created in Kernel mode. Each process
                would be unique by having an ID. These processes will be used later to have roles
                in storing information, removing, etc. Once my processes are coded, then I have to code 
                in <a href="CPUCodeText/CPULocks1.txt">locks</a> 
                and <a href="CPUCodeText/CPUCond1.txt">conditions</a>. This would allow me 
                to use threads to allow certain processes to be run first before other, aka
                mutual exclusion and critical section. You can view how I code this part 
                in my <a href="https://github.com/Cephuez/PastProjects/tree/main/Simulate%20CPU%20Project">project page</a>

            <p> Now that I had working processes, my next task is for user processes to call kernel
                processes. This would allow <a href="CPUCodeText/CPUHandlers1.txt">system calls</a>. 
                to handle kernel processes like calling 'Wait' for a proccess
                to hault, 'Terminate' to delete a process, 'GetPid' to get the process' ID, 
                and 'GetTimeOfDay' to get the time of the day set on the CPU. All of these
                handlers are stored inside an array of Interrupt Vectors. Depending if it is 
                an Illegal Interrupt or System Call, it will call certain handlers to deal with 
                the issue. Since these handlers are very important, they will be proccesses run at number 1 
                priority over any other processes. Furthermore, now that I have handlers set up, I 
                can code in Disk write and read. User processes can call Kernel processes to handle 
                writing and reading of disks. This will build up the code to manage memory in 
                virtual space for my last part. View Phase2A-Phase2D for this part.

            <p> When it came to storing data into memory, I used virtual addresses in order to 
                give them a position in the storage space. I approached it through paging in 
                <a href="CPUCodeText/CPUFrame.txt">frames</a>. These frames are giving a process ID
                to distinguish it from other processes, page boolean to see if it's set up, and 
                a free boolean to see if that area is free to be accessed or not. I set up an array size 
                of pages called Page Table. This is where all the pages would be allocated into. Check 
                phase3A-Phase3B for this part.

            For this project, I learned how to multi-thread with process and making sure that
            processes start, stop, or terminate at the correct time. Otherwise, the 
            CPU's memory management would be all over the place. I coded my own virtual 
            memory space where pages are assigned into and apply algorithms to store them
            in the fastest and least space possible. I wrote into disk and read them from 
            a user level by making kernel mode do all the work. This would prevent user mode 
            from damaging any part of the CPU if they had full access of kernel mode.
