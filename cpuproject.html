        <p>
            A quick summary of programming my CPU project in C. I worked with processes and threadings 
            in order to make sure that memory management is not disrupted. I made sure 
            to synchronize my program to ensure mutual exclusion and critical section. 
            If I were to allow processes to input information without an order, then 
            memory would be updated too soon or late for it to be accessed. 
        </p>

            <p> 
                I made sure to code in the <a href="CPUCodeText/CPULocks1.txt">locks</a> 
                and <a href="CPUCodeText/CPUCond1.txt">conditions</a> so I can know what 
                processes to use when active. If you want to view my code in more details 
                on how I lock processes, free them, etc, I have linked my project to the
                site at the top under phase1a, phase1b, phase1c, and phase1d.

            <p> Using locks and conditions in order to organize my processes, I was able
                to use <a href="CPUCodeText/CPUHandlers1.txt">System Call Handlers</a>. Some examples is calling 'Wait' for a proccess
                to hault, 'Terminate' to delete a process, 'GetPid' to get the process' ID, 
                and 'GetTimeOfDay' to get the time of the day set on the CPU. All of these
                handlers are stored inside an array of Interrupt Vectors. Depending if it is 
                an Illegal Interrupt or System Call, it will call certain handlers to deal with 
                the issue. Check Phase2a-Phase2d.

            <p> When it came to storing data into memory, I used virtual addresses in order to 
                give them a position in the storage space. I approached it through paging in 
                <a href="CPUCodeText/CPUFrame.txt">frames</a>. These frames are giving a process ID
                to distinguish it from other processes, page boolean to see if it's set up, and 
                a free boolean to see if that area is free to be accessed or not. Look under Phase3a
                and Phase3b for further details.
