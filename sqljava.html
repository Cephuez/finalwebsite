        <h2>
            I've added this project under my github repository. 
            <a href="https://github.com/Cephuez/PastProjects/tree/main/SQLProject/ProjectLayout">Click Here</a> 
            and you will be navigated to the project's layout. Since I used tables for this 
            SQL project, <a href="sql_text.txt">click here</a> to have a reference of it. 
            It's a little tricky to demonstrate a demo of my project since it requires
            me to access my University's server which I don't have any access to anymore. 
            I will try to do my best to explain the project while backing it up with 
            screenshots of my code.

            <p> In order to access the page, the
                user needs to have a membership. If the user does not have a membership, then
                they can register by clicking the 'register' button.

            <p> In the registration page, you are prompt to put in information about yourself: 
                email, name, self introduction, location, birthday, if you are an adopter, if you
                are a sender, and your adopting experience. Using PreparedStatement I used the code in the picture. 
                This will submit the information under the table Member.

            <img src="Images/PetAdopt2.png" id="img">
            <p> If you register as a sender, then you are asked with further questions about
                what kind of pet you want to set up for adoption. The only breed types I set up
                were rabbit, dog, and cat. If you picked a cat for example, then you would 
                type the pet's name, birthday, and if it's sterilized. The program would then link 
                the pet to the member's email to track its owner.

            <p> Once you have set up your registration, you can access the website by 
                logging at the home page. I used HttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse, and 
                DriverManager to access the server if the user's email is valid. I do a quick SQL code 
                to check if the user's email is in the server.
