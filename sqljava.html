            I've added this project under my github repository. 
            <a href="https://github.com/Cephuez/PastProjects/tree/main/SQLProject/ProjectLayout">Click Here</a> 
            and you will be navigated to the project's layout. Since I used tables for this 
            SQL project, <a href="sql_text.txt">click here</a> to have a reference of it. 
            It's a little tricky to demonstrate a demo of my project since it requires
            me to access my University's server which I don't have access to anymore. 
            I will try to do my best to explain the project while backing it up with 
            screenshots.

        <h2>
            For my pet adoption website, a user needs to have a register before logging into 
            the website. Like any other websites, they register by inputting
            their personal information. They also have the option to register as a sender 
            and input information of the pet they are sending out. Since I only allowed dogs, 
            cats, and rabbits to put up for adoption, only information for those pets will be asked.
            Once registered, they can log in to view any pets currently available for 
            adoption and mark favorites to view them again. Once the user is done, they can 
            log out of the site.

            <p> In order to access the page, the user needs to have a membership. For my 
                project, the user needs to register using their email. If they are wrong,
                then they will be prompted again. For any new users, they can click the
                register button to make their own account.

            <p> In the registration page, you are prompt to put in information about yourself: 
                email, name, self introduction, location, and birthday. You will also be asked if
                you are an adopter or a sender. If you register as a sender, then you will
                be asked to register your pet. Using PreparedStatements as shown in the picture, 
                the person's information will be added under Member table to keep track of their
                information in the server.

            <p> If you register as a sender, then you're asked with further questions about
                the kind of pet you are setting up for adoption. The primary questions asked for 
                a pet would be their name, birthday, breed, and if they are sterilized. Extra questions 
                will be asked for a dog if they require a number of days to be walked, or if a rabbit 
                tends to bite things. Once the user input this information, the information will be 
                added to the server plus the user's email in order to track the pet's sender.

            <p> Once you have set up your registration, you can access the website by 
                logging at the home page. I used HttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse, and 
                DriverManager to access the server if the user's email is valid. I do a quick SQL code 
                to check if the user's email is in the server.
